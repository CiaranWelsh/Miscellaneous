Demo_project8_IQM_project is already set up to run and will run, provided IQM is installed (and you've ran the install script after opening Matlab). In fact, it already has been run and the results are in the excel file. 

The other projects are examples for the future since a bug or two exists in the current Matlab script, though the Python program prep_IQM.py will work on the parent project.
