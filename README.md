# LASSO Regression
In this work I am trying to use time course expression data from WaferGen and Microarray to produce a correlation matrix for each gene in our set of genes. I use a lasso regression model to select features with a non-zero coefficient which are then candidates for regulators. A jupyter notebook provides implements the methods which utilie sklearn, a python package for machine learning.
