Performed pilot WG analysis again to try out some QC plots and write in form of ipynb. Not sure how meningful the distribution plots are given the two chips contain different genes. Look pretty for poster though.

The PCA shows that the IR data set is more variable than the other two which align quite nicely.

Also note the clusters in the PCA.  It'd be nice if (say) col11a1/col1a2 cluster together in the pca.
